run_analysis.R performs the following (in short)

1. Merges the training and test data sets into one called "totalFeatures".
2. Uses only the mean or standard deviations from the original dataset
3. Includes the subject id to the data frame ("totalSubjects")
4. Includes the names of the activities performed  by the ids ("activityLabels") to the single data frame called "activityDF"
5. Organises the "activityDF" by subjectID and activity and saves the "result" as a txt file ("mean_results.txt").
